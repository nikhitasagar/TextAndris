This application was created by three tenth
 	   		graders <ul><li>Animesh Garg</li><li> Daksh Chhokra
 	   		</li><li>Ritwic Singh<u></u></li></ul> under the guidance of: <ul><li>Ankur Aggarwal</li><li>Shivani Kapoor</li></ul> 

 	   		This application has been created to help the people who
 	   		sometimes forget their friends and relatives
 	   		birthdays and anniversaries. They can also wish them on
 	   		scheduled holidays and festivals. This application will
 	   		help you schedule and SMS at an exact time and date when
 	   		you want to send that SMS and will automatically send it
 	   		from your cellular device at the time you have
 	   		specified.

 	   		The user can edit and delete the scheduled messages
 	   		before they are sent and a log will be provided to view
 	   		your sent messages. The user can also use a Clear Log
 	   		function to remove the bulk which is not required from
 	   		your log.
